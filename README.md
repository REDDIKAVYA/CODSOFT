# CODSOFT
This repository showcases completion of three tasks from the CodSoft AI Internship. It includes implementations of 1. A rule-based responses chatbot, 2. A Tic-Tac-Toe AI game, and 3. A face detection and recognition system. This repository serves as a demonstration of completed internship tasks and welcomes collaboration and contributions.
# CodSoft - AI Internship
# TASK-1: CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSES
Build a basic chatbot capable of engaging in simple conversations. It responds to greetings, provides information about itself, shares jokes and interesting facts, and offers the current time upon request. Users can interact with the chatbot The chatbot continues the conversation until the user types "bye" to exit. It's a beginner-friendly project suitable for learning about natural language processing and basic AI concepts. This project serves as an educational resource for Python developers interested in creating their own chatbots.

# TASK-2: TIC-TAC-TOE AI GAME
This project is about a Python-based Tic Tac Toe game with an AI opponent. The game is built using Tkinter for the graphical user interface. It features both single-player and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the player can challenge an AI opponent based on the minimax algorithm, providing a challenging experience. The game interface is intuitive and visually appealing. Players can restart the game at any point and enjoy seamless gameplay. This project serves as an excellent demonstration of implementing AI algorithms in a classic game scenario. It's a fun and educational project for both beginners and intermediate Python developers interested in game development and AI.
